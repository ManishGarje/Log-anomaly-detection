# Log-anomaly-detection
In computing, logging is the act of keeping a log of events that occur in a computer system, such as problems, errors or just information on current operations. These events may occur in the operating system or in other software. A message or log entry is recorded for each such event. Log Anomaly Detection is simply detecting anomalies in logs deposited by softwares using Machine Learning.

Anomaly is anything that is different from what is usually perceived as normal - an exception. In software engineering, anomaly can be defined as occurrence of rare or unexpected events that does not fit into the normal patterns and hence a suspicious one. Examples could be:

Unexpected failure of a service
Sudden increase/decrease of user activity in a customer facing system
Reasons for these anomalies could be different, like:
Entry of unperceived inputs to the system
System running out of memory
